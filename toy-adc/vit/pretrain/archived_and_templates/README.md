1. bert-vitconv.py: 
	- 128x128, 8x8;
	- positional embedding: 384; number of features: 384. I think the number is a little too big, especially for positional embedding. I will try a smaller positional embedding and total number of features in the next file
1. bert-vitconv_small.py:
	- 128x128, 8x8;
	- positional embedding: 64;
	- number of features: 128;
